NewReputationBased creates "leader election based on reputation" strategy implementation.

  - "validators" is (sorted!) list of peer IDs to use for round-robin leader selection
    when there is no elected leader for the round;
  - the "windowSize" is number of committed blocks to use to determine list of active
    validators (ie those which voted). It must not be larger than the "block history"
    available to the blockLoader, IOW the "blockLoader" must be able to return blocks
    at least inside the window.
  - "excludeSize" is the number of most recent block authors to exclude form candidate
    list when electing leader for the next round. Generally should be between f and 2f
    (where f is max allowed number of faulty nodes).
